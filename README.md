# Robust Multivariable Control

1. Analytical solution of second order solution and compare with step() function from MATLAB.
Use various numerators with no zero and one zero.

2. Calculate natural frequency, damping ratio and damped frequency to estimate the percent overshoot, peak time and
settling time. 
Analyze effect of zero of the system.

3. Identify if given systems are stable or unstable and calculate settling time and verify your results using
a Matlab simulation.
